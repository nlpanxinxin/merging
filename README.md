# merging
Here we provide a demo code and high-precision figures for our Global-RS.

Run the file newRegionMerge.m first, then the needed other files can be called automatically.

This code has been tested on the MATLAB 2017b in a windows 10 operating system.


For the HQS code in C++, avaiable at https://github.com/YunyangXu/HQSGRD.
For the BDCN in Python, avaiable at https://github.com/pkuCactus/BDCN.
